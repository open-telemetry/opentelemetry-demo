# Cost optimization tips:
# 
# For development/testing:
# - Use SPOT instances: app_node_capacity_type = "SPOT"
# - Reduce node count: app_node_desired_size = 1
# - Use smaller instances: app_node_instance_type = "t3.medium"
# - Single NAT Gateway (already configured for dev environment)
#
# For production:
# - Use ON_DEMAND instances
# - Multiple AZs with sufficient capacity
# - Enable cluster autoscaler
# - Monitor costs with Cost Explorer

description: |
  Semantic conventions and telemetry schema for the OpenTelemetry Demo application.
  This schema defines all custom attributes and metrics used across the demo services.

  This registry was generated by analyzing actual attribute usage across the codebase,
  not copied from an external source. It reflects the real telemetry instrumentation
  in the demo application.

  Attributes are organized by service in the attributes/ directory.
  Metrics are organized by service in the metrics/ directory.

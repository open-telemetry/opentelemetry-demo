# OpenTelemetry Demo Telemetry Schema

Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Demo telemetry schema documentation. This site documents all custom attributes and metrics used across the demo services.

## Services

The demo application consists of multiple microservices, each with its own telemetry schema. Browse the services in the navigation to explore:

- **Attributes** - Custom span attributes used by each service
- **Metrics** - Custom metrics emitted by each service
- **Stability** - Stability level of each telemetry signal

## Schema Organization

The telemetry schema is organized by:

1. **Logical Attribute Groups** - Semantic domain-focused attribute definitions in `common.yaml`
2. **Service Registries** - Service-specific attribute and metric definitions

Each service references logical attribute groups using the `ref` syntax, creating a separation between logical groupings and service-specific usage patterns.

## Schema Files

- `telemetry-schema/registry_manifest.yaml` - Registry metadata
- `telemetry-schema/attributes/common.yaml` - Logical attribute group definitions
- `telemetry-schema/attributes/{service}.yaml` - Service-specific attribute registries
- `telemetry-schema/metrics/{service}.yaml` - Service-specific metric definitions

## Getting Started

1. Select a service from the navigation menu
2. Review the attributes and metrics for that service
3. Check the stability level and examples for each telemetry signal

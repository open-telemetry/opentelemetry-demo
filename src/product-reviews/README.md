# Product Reviews Service

This service returns product reviews for a specific product, along with an AI-generated 
summary of the product reviews. 

## Local Build

To build the protos, run from the root directory:

```sh
make docker-generate-protobuf
```

## Docker Build

From the root directory, run:

```sh
docker compose build product-reviews
```

## LLM Configuration 

By default, this service uses a mock LLM service, as configured in the `.env` file: 

``` yaml
LLM_BASE_URL=http://${LLM_HOST}:${LLM_PORT}/v1
LLM_MODEL=astronomy-llm
OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy
```

If desired, the configuration can be changed to point to a real, OpenAI API compatible LLM. 
For example, the following configuration can be used to utilize OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model: 

``` yaml
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=<replace with API key>
```
